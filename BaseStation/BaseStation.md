# BaseStation

## Info
This code also runs on an Adafruit Feather M0. Mine runs on the logger version, but it doesn't need to. All the Feather is doing is reading the packets from the HC12 and outputting them via serial to PC.
An Arduino would work fine, but I wanted to use a feather so I could incoorperate 2 hardware serial ports and an LCD.
